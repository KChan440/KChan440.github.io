It all started at a tech event where I was partnered with a girl and had no idea what to talk to her about. I felt that although general games like 21 questions exist, it's hard for someone to think of topics that would really let you get to know someone. I allow users to like and dislike questions as well as submit their own. Built in ReactJS, connected to a firebase database and hosted on Google Cloud.</p>\n            </Carousel.Caption>\n            </Carousel.Item>\n            <Carousel.Item>\n            <div className=\"center\">\n            <img\n            className=\"bridgehacs\"\n            src=\"../static/bridgehacs.png\"\n            alt=\"Third slide\"\n            />\n            </div>\n            <Carousel.Caption>\n            <a href=\"http://bridgehacs.herokuapp.com/\">\n            <h2>Bridgehacs</h2>\n            </a>\n            <p>During the Summer of 2016, I was interning around Boston and wanted a way to meet other interns/developers/professionals (honestly was just a little lonely). I looked for hackathons but when I found there were none, I decided to host my own. I built the website that had a form connected to firebase for RSVPs.</p>\n            <p>I was able to get 97 attendees representing 24 different colleges, and had judges from IBM/Vistaprint as well as sponsors from companies like Twilio and DigitalOcean. I was able to get Microsoft to host my event, and the winners were able to receive some prizes too. It was a super fun event and I learned a lot about the development community around Massachussets. The event really propelled my interest in tech further than ever.</p>\n            </Carousel.Caption>\n            </Carousel.Item>\n            <Carousel.Item>\n            <img\n            className=\"d-block w-100\"\n            src=\"../static/download.svg\"\n            alt=\"Third slide\"\n            />\n            <Carousel.Caption>\n            <h3>Third slide label</h3>\n            <p>Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur.</p>\n            </Carousel.Caption>\n            </Carousel.Item>\n            </Carousel>\n            <style jsx global>{`\n                body { \n                    background-color: black;\n                }\n                `}</style>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AApDA;AAAA;AAAA;AA+DA;;;;AAlEA;AACA;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
